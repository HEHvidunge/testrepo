## Task j i ##
[Link to the file](https://github.com/CDHUppsala/Gallica_pdf/blob/7623d738c5efb188a1b87b64e11cad28eb7e05b4/get_pdf.py)

## Task j ii ##
The file get_dpf.py uses the following libraries:
- 'urllib.request'
- 'urllib.error'
- 'urllib.parse'
- 'bs4'
- 'time'
- 'requests'

## Task j iii ##
Here are a few examples of how the libraries are used in the code.
* 'opener = urllib.request.build_opener()'
* 'except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:'
* 'urllib.request.urlretrieve(pdf_link, foldername+"/"+pdf_name,headers=headers)'

## Task l iv ##
Of the libaries above only 'time' is internal. The rest are external-

## Task l v ##
Version control is important to track changes in code. Even if you work alone you you risk loose track of what you've done.
A new version might solve some issues while created new ones. What was intended as improvement might turn out bad.
Being able to backtrack to a working version is essential.
I have been using version control before, but not any diff tools. I will consider to start using it.
